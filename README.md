# Looney Tunes

Bunch of small, sometimes funny, sometimes useless scripts:

:radio_button: `screenshot.sh`

Just take screenshot and save in home directory

:radio_button: `sleep.sh`

Sleep until get SIGINT, SIGTERM, or SIGUSR1 signal

```bash
# Run with default 30 seconds loop
./sleep.sh
# Run with specified length of loop. Ex. 15
./sleep.sh 15
```
